The `If-None-Match` HTTP request header is used for **conditional requests** 
to check whether a cached resource is still valid. It helps optimize network 
efficiency by avoiding unnecessary downloads of unchanged resources.

### How It Works:
1. **Server Provides ETag**:  
   - When the server first sends a resource (e.g., a file), it includes an `ETag` header 
     (a unique identifier for the resource's version, often a hash or timestamp).  
   - Example:  
     ```http
     ETag: "abc123"
     ```

2. **Client Caches the Resource & ETag**:  
   - The browser (or client) stores both the resource and its `ETag`.

3. **Subsequent Request with `If-None-Match`**:  
   - When the client needs the same resource again, it sends the cached `ETag` back in 
     the `If-None-Match` header.  
   - Example:  
     ```http
     If-None-Match: "abc123"
     ```

4. **Server Compares ETags**:  
   - If the current `ETag` of the resource matches the `If-None-Match` value:  
     - The server responds with **`304 Not Modified`** (empty body), telling the client 
       to reuse its cached copy.  
   - If the `ETag` differs:  
     - The server sends a **`200 OK`** with the new resource and updated `ETag`.

### Example Flow:
1. **First Request**:  
   ```
   GET /static/photo.jpg
   ```
   **Response**:  
   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ETag: "xyz789"
   Content-Length: 1024
   [File data]
   ```

2. **Second Request (Cached)**:  
   ```http
   GET /static/photo.jpg
   If-None-Match: "xyz789"
   ```
   **Response (if unchanged)**:  
   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
   ```

### Key Benefits:
- **Reduces Bandwidth**: Avoids re-downloading unchanged files.  
- **Faster Load Times**: Clients use cached versions when valid.
