Preload
  Inform the browser of critical resources before they are discovered


Preload (<link rel="preload">) is a browser optimization that allows
  critical resources (that may be discovered late) to be to be requested earlier.


If you are trying to optimize the loading of rst-party JavaScript, you can also consider using 
  <script defer> in the document <head> vs. <body> to help with early discover of these resources.

A preloaded XComponent could be loaded in parallel with the initial bundle. Unlike prefetch, where 
  the browser still had a say in whether it think it's got a good enough internet connection and bandwidth 
  to actually prefetch the resource, a preloaded resource will get preloaded no matter what.

As we're loading assets with smarter ordering, the initial loading time may increase signi cantly
  depending on your users device and internet connection. Only preload the
  resources that have to be visible ~1 second after the initial render.

Use preload sparingly and always measure its impact in production. If the preload for your image 
  is earlier in the document than it is, this can help browsers discover it 
  (and order relative to other resources). When used incorrectly, preloading can cause your image to delay 
  First Contentful Paint (e.g CSS, Fonts) - the opposite of what you want. Also note that for such
  reprioritization efforts to be effective, it also depends on servers prioritizing requests correctly.

You may also nd <link rel="preload"> to be helpful for cases where
  you need to fetch scripts without executing them.
