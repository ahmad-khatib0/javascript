j- Higher-order components (HOC): 
    are an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. Meaning a 
    higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component
  
-- Context
    In a typical React app, data is passed down via props, but this can be cumbersome for some 
    types of props that are required by many components within an application. Context provides 
    a way to share these types of data between components without having to explicitly pass a 
    prop through every level of hierarchy. Meaning with context, we can avoid passing props 
    through intermediate elements.




-- Singleton Pattern:  Share a single global instance throughout our application

-- Proxy Pattern    :  Share a single global instance throughout our application

-- Provider Pattern :  Make data available to multiple child components

-- Prototype Pattern:  Share properties among many objects of the same type
