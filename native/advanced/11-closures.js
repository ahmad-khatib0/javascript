// because function C.  Is inside a function A and function B, the JavaScript engine is going to say, All
//  right, I'LL CREATE A CLOSURE FOR YOU.  All the variables outside of the c function.
// I'm going to KEEP AROUND if C is using it.  so random variable won't be KEPT 

// JavaScript engine before we run any code, before we get to line 12 or line 13 already knows which function
//  has access to which variables because JavaScript is lexical scoped or statically scoped.

const boo = (string) => (name) => (name2) => console.log(`${string} ${name} ${name2}`);
boo('hey')('ahmad')("al hussein")  //hey ahmad al hussein

// why closures are powerful ? 
const booString = boo("hello")
// wait for 5 years !!
const booStringName = booString('ahmad')
// I could hypothetically, if the JavaScript engine is running, wait five years and then finally call
// booString and booString even though it would be off the stack or the boo function is off the stack!!.
// Will still remember for me this high that we gave it five years ago.That's because remember
// parameters are treated just like local variables that gets stored in variable environments.

// another example 
function callMeMaybe() {
  const message = 'hey i\'m now here!'
  //so message maybe has been popped off the stack by the time after callMeMaybe() execution.
  // But because of closures and yes, even if some of the functions go all the way out to the Web API world,
  // well, they still use closures and we're able to remember this variable because of closures.
  setTimeout(function () { console.log(message) }, 4000)

callMeMaybe()


function callMeMaybe() {
  setTimeout(function () { console.log(message) }, 4000)
  const message = 'hey i\'m now here!' //after putting message here what it will log? undefined? 
}
//NO. hey i'm now here!,  why?
// Even if const doesn't get hoisted. We don't care about hoisting here.
// Instead, this piece of code 1- goes all the way into web API world, 2- gets put on the callback queue.
// 3- The event Loop pushes it back onto the stack, but by that time we already ran this function.
// const message, has already been created and assigned and because it sees that there's an enclosing
// function that is using it, it's going to create a closure. so it wil KEEP A REFERENCE TO THIS CONST


///////////////////////// BENEFITS OF CLOSURES ///////////////////////////
// 1- memory efficient
