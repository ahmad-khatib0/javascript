-- SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
The Session Initiation Protocol is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and 
    terminating communication sessions that include voice, video and messaging applications. SIP is used 
    in Internet telephony, in private IP telephone systems, as well as mobile phone calling over LTE

-- JavaScript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP)
    The communication model between a client and remote host is based on the JSEP 
    architecture, which differentiates the signaling and media transaction into different layers.


-- The signaling mechanism can be any among HTTP/REST, JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON) via XMLHttpRequest (XHR), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over websockets, 
    XMPP, or any custom or proprietary protocol. The media (audio/video) is defined through the 
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) and flows from peer to peer.


-- IP Multimedia System (IMS) is part of the Next Generation
    Network (NGN) model for IP-based communication.

-- WebRTC works in an offer/answer mode and has ways of traversing the Network Address Translation (NAT) 
   and firewalls by means of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). ICE makes use of the Session
   Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its extension, Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).


-- WebRTC mainly comprises three operations: fetching user media from a camera/microphone, 
   transmitting media over a channel, and sending messages over the channel.
