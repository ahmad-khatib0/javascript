app.set("trust proxy" , true)
  The reason for this is that traffic is being proxied to our application through ingress.
  Express is going to see the fact that stuff is being proxy and by default, Express is going to say,
  Hey, wait, there's a proxy here.  I don't really trust this HTTPS connection.
  Long story short, we are just adding in this little step right here to make sure that Express is aware
  that it's behind a proxy of ingress-nginx, and to make sure that it should still trust traffic as
  being secure, even though it's coming from that proxy.
