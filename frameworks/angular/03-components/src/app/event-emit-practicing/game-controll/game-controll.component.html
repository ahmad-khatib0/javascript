        <ol>
          <li>Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>
          <li>
            The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the
            game
          </li>
          <li>
            When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number)
            should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
          </li>
          <li>The event should be listenable from outside the component</li>
          <li>
            When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted
            (clearInterval(ref))
          </li>
          <li>
            A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted,
            the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
          </li>
          <li>
            Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
          </li>
          <li>
            Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text
            differently in both components
          </li>
        </ol>
